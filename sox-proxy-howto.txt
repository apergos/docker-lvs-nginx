if I wanted to test in ff I would...

  ssh -D 11111 me@dockerserver

  then set up ff to manual proxy, localhost, port 11111, I think socks5 is the default
  turn it off as soon as done because *all* refreshes etc go through there (think
  google, fb, twitter, every other page that constantly refreshes)
