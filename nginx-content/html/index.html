<p>
This is nginx-content.  If you got here you should have sent a request
on 80 or 443 only to nginx-content for everything except the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>redirtesting/any url (80 or 443) (goes to 'redirected')
<li>Host header wronghostname (80) (goes to 'wronghostname')</li>
</ul>
TBH we could see requests manually coming for wronghostname on 443 but
in normal operation we shouldn't see them.
