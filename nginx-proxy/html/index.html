This is nginx-proxy.  If you got here, that's a problem because this server
actually just proxies for requests to 'wronghostname' as received from
lvs-dr.  If you send a request directly to this host, I guess that could
happen, in which case we should reject everything but the above requests
(on either 80 or 443) which would be forwarded to nginx-content (contentserver).
